the wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round.
the wheels on the bus go round and round, all through the town.
the wipers on the bus go swish swish swish, swish swish swish, swish swish swish.
the wipers on the bus go swish swish swish, all through the town.
the baby on the bus go waa waa waa, waa waa waa, waa waa waa.
the baby on the bus go waa waa waa, all throuh the town.
